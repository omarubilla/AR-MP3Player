# AR-MP3Player

Our goal is to recognize hand gestures in order to navigate our mp3 player!

1. Download zip
2. node_modules > fingerpose > dist > index.html
3. Click "Allow" camera in browser.
4. Display open palm gesture to actuate the hand pose model.
5. Show a sideways 'thumb's up' gesture to play the song OR a 'peace-sign' gesture to pause.
6. You may change the song by modifying fingerpose.js
